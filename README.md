# War Eagle Rockets
This is a project that I'm doing for my sister for use at her summer camp, Camp War Eagle.
It is a scoreboard of sorts where each rocket represents a team and how many activities (?) they've completed (or points they've earned, idk).

All pictures used are held under the creative commons license and are property of their respective owners.

This project is hosted on GitHub pages for ease of access (though, it is designed to be run locally by simply downloading the code).
The site can be accessed [here](https://gippies.github.io/WarEagleRockets/).

Note that the master branch is automatically deployed to the site, so the 'dev' branch is used for development before merging to master.
